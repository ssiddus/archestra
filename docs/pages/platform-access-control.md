Archestra uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions. This system provides both predefined roles for common use cases and the flexibility to create custom roles with specific permission combinations.

Permissions in Archestra are defined using a `resource:action` format, where:

- **Resource**: The type of object or feature being accessed (e.g., `agent`, `mcpGateway`, `llmProxy`)
- **Action**: The operation being performed (`create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `admin`)

For example, the permission `agent:create` allows creating new agents, `mcpGateway:update` allows updating MCP gateways, whereas `llmProxy:read` would allow reading LLM proxies.

## Predefined Roles

The following roles are built into Archestra and cannot be modified or deleted:

### Admin

Full access to all resources including user management, roles, and platform settings

The admin role has **all permissions** on every resource.

### Editor

Full access to core resources and settings, but cannot manage users, roles, or identity providers

## Custom Roles

Users with `ac:create` permission can create custom roles by selecting specific permission combinations. Custom roles allow fine-grained access control tailored to your needs. Note that you can only grant permissions that you already possess — this prevents privilege escalation.

## Best Practices

### Principle of Least Privilege

Grant users only the minimum permissions necessary for their role. Start with the "Member" role and add specific permissions as needed.

### Team-Based Organization

Combine roles with team-based access control for fine-grained resource access:

1. **Create teams** for different groups (e.g., "Data Scientists", "Developers")
2. **Assign Agents, MCP Gateways, LLM Proxies, and MCP Servers** to specific teams
3. **Add users to teams** based on their role and responsibilities

#### Default Team

New users are automatically added to the "Default Team" when they accept an invitation. This ensures all users have immediate access to Archestra resources assigned to this team.

#### Team Access Control Rules

**For MCP Gateways, LLM Proxies, and Agents:**

- Users can only see agents assigned to teams they belong to
- Exception: Users with `agent:admin` permission can see all agents
- Exception: Agents with no team assignment are visible to all users

**For MCP Servers:**

- Users can only access MCP servers assigned to teams they belong to
- Exception: Users with `mcpServer:admin` permission can access all MCP servers
- Exception: MCP servers with no team assignment are accessible to all users

**Associated Artifacts:**

Team-based access extends to related resources like interaction logs, policies, and tool assignments. Members can only view these artifacts for agents and MCP servers they have access to.

### Regular Review

Periodically review custom roles and team membership assignments to ensure they align with current needs and security requirements.

### Role Naming

Use clear, descriptive names for custom roles that indicate their purpose (e.g., "Agent-Manager", "Read-Only-Analyst", "Tool-Developer").
